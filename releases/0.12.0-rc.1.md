## bitergia-analytics-plugin 0.12.0-rc.1 - (2023-10-24)

**New features:**

 * Only show links to users with permissions\
   Many OpenSearch Dashboards plugins require special permissions. To
   avoid confusing non-privileged users, links to them are hidden on the
   lef sidebar menu. To disable them, users need the
   `bap_plugins_visibility` role. Links to the Dashboards, Discover and
   Visualize sections are visible to all users.
