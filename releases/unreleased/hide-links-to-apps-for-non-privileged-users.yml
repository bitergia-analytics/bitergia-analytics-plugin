title: Only show links to users with permissions

  Many OpenSearch Dashboards plugins require special
  permissions. To avoid confusing non-privileged users,
  links to them are hidden on the lef sidebar menu.
  To disable them, users need the `bap_plugins_visibility`
  role. Links to the Dashboards, Discover and Visualize
  sections are visible to all users.
