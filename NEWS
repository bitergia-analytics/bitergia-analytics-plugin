**New features:**

 * Only show links to users with permissions\
   Many OpenSearch Dashboards plugins require special permissions. To
   avoid confusing non-privileged users, links to them are hidden on the
   lef sidebar menu. To disable them, users need the
   `bap_plugins_visibility` role. Links to the Dashboards, Discover and
   Visualize sections are visible to all users.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix build error\
   Fixes an error in the plugin build that prevented OpenSearch
   Dashboards from loading.

**Others:**

 * New version of the Bitergia Analytics plugin\
   New version of the Bitergia Analytics plugin
